# MEATY
Meme Ecosystem Analysis Toolkit, Yo

A proof-of-concept module to collect and analyze facebook meme group behavior. Scrapes posts (poster, img, title, description, reacts, etc.) and membership (who's in the group and when they were added, nothing weird). Uses image hash to find duplicates scrapes/reposts and  Google Vision API for OCR.
